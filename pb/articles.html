<p><i><font color="#800040">There have been good chip musicians, but trying
to make bleepy stuff sound really good is a bit like trying to do a heavy
metal song with a couple of plastic banjos!</font></i></p>
</ul>
<p>If this is your first introduction to the world of the computer scene,
then you might be confused by some of the terms that are used. Don't worry,
we want you to understand what the hell we're talking about! So, for your
rough guide to underground terminology, read this informative (?) article
by <b>EGBs Smelly Sox</b></p>

hand circle have just offered up my black soul to the horn-ed one as a
token of my undying servitude towards him.</font></i></p>

<p>And so on. Yes, we <i>are </i>serious. Well, actually, no we aren't.

people that just by existing, indie bands deserve some sort of crown, like
an award or a No.1 single</font></i></p>
</ul>
<p>Now you too can read the letter <b>Melody Maker</b> didn't publish (Probably
because it was too long) in which <b>EGBs Smelly Sox</b> rails against
the hyprocracy of the criticism of <b>M People</b>, rants on about "journos
and indie saddoes", swears even more times than MM's own <b>Mr Agreeable</b>
(Only this time, it's <i>not </i>censored!), and rather amusingly notes
that the title of a certain well-known album by <b>Blur </b>rhymes with
"no-life"! Ho ho!</p>
