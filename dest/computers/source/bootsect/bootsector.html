<p><i>This article originally appeared in <b>Ledgers disk magazine issue
11, </b>August 1992.</i></p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>Are you one of those people who blunder through life with clean bootsectors
on your disks? Well, then I'd say you're bloody lucky not get a virus on
them. What's your secret? </p>
<p>No, you're more likely to put some nice looking antivirus bootsector
on it, like the 'English' antivirus or the 4 meg incompatible Medway Boys
Virus protector 3. But have you ever stopped to think <i>'Wow! I wonder
how that's all done in such a small 512 byte space?'</i> Stop looking at
the screen like that, of course you have. Well, that's what this article
is all about. </p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>First the really boring theory bit. Did you know that not all of the
bootsector can be used for your coding experiments? I'm afraid it's true.
Some of the meagre 512 bytes is used by the system in order to determine
the format of the disk. Yes, I know it's annoying. Why the system can't
work out how to read the disk by itself without needing to read a couple
of bytes which could be used for some hyper-optimised code I don't know.
Still, that's the way it is. So let's look at the bits you <i>have</i>
to put in the bootsector. </p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Byte No.</b> </dt>
<dd>Function </dd>
<dt><b>00 - 01</b> </dt>
<dd>bra.s command. Usually bra.s + $38. Jumps to bootcode. If the boot's
not executable, then it's just a word value of 0 </dd>
<dt><b>02 - 07</b> </dt>
<dd>'Loader' - has absolutely no function other than that of ego trip,
since you have 6 chars space to put your initials in!! In a 'Clean' disk,
it's 'IBM V' (As in MS-DOS) </dd>
<dt><b>08 - 10</b> </dt>
<dd>24 bit disk serial number. Not really very useful! </dd>
<dt><b>11 - 12</b> </dt>
<dd>Bytes per sector. Like wow, you could have <i>1024 byte sector disks!</i>
(Except that GEM won't like it very much.) </dd>
<dt><b>13</b> </dt>
<dd>Sectors per cluster. Clusters are blocks used by the DOS to store files.
The default in Atari GEMDOS (And old MSDOS on DD disks) is 2, which is
1K (2 * 512 byte sectors.) </dd>
<dt><b>14 - 15</b> </dt>
<dd>No. of reserved sectors. In other words, just the bootsector ie 1 on
any disk. </dd>
<dt><b>16</b> </dt>
<dd>No. of file allocation tables. That's where DOS looks when it wants
to work out where a file starts and ends on a disk. </dd>
<dt><b>17 - 18</b> </dt>
<dd>Max no of directory entries. Guess what that's for! </dd>
<dt><b>19 - 20</b> </dt>
<dd>The TOTAL number of sectors on a disk. For example an 81 track 10 sector
double sided disk has ermmmm, where's my calculator? ... Hang on... 81
times 10 is 810, times 2 is,.... yes, 1620 sectors, I think. </dd>
<dt><b>21</b> </dt>
<dd>This apparently is the 'Media Descriptor Byte', which is not used by
the ST, but is used by MS-DOS. Wow! (So if you want your ST programs readable
on PCs for some odd reason, then don't leave this byte out!) </dd>
<dt><b>22 - 23</b> </dt>
<dd>The number of sectors per file allocation table. I don't need to tell
you how exciting that is. </dd>
<dt><b>24 - 25</b> </dt>
<dd>Number of sectors per track. Usually 9 or 10 or even (if you are really
naughty!!!) 11! Of course if you have a high density drive (eg in a Falcon
030), it can be anything up to 21 sectors. </dd>
<dt><b>26 - 27</b> </dt>
<dd>Number of sides. Now I don't need to tell you which number I think
SHOULD be default. Clue: single sided drives went out with half meg STFMs.
</dd>
<dt><b>28 - 29</b> </dt>
<dd>Number of hidden sectors! I don't think this is ever used, but if you
want to be the first.... </dd>
<dt><b>30 -</b> </dt>
<dd>After all that, <b>then</b> your boot code starts! </dd>
<dt><b>510 - 511</b> </dt>
<dd>Checksum number. Add this to a word checksum of the rest of the bootsector,
and if it comes to <b>$1234</b> (ie 1234 in hexidecimal notation), then
the bootsector is executable, and the code from byte 30 onwards will be
executed when the bootsector is loaded. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Some of you might have noticed that there's no mention of the number
of actual tracks in a disk. This, believe it or not, is one of the few
things the computer can work out by itself, by dividing the total number
of sectors by the number of sectors per track. </p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that the code in the bootsector is executed
in supervisor mode. It's <b>has</b> to be pc-relative and <b>has</b> to
end with an <b>rts</b>. </p>
<p>Another thing you might have noticed is that your code can start at
byte 30. Now 30 is $1e in hex, but most documented executable boot code
for some odd reason starts at byte $38 or byte 56! So there's a lot of
space there that could be used. In fact, <i>Fastcopy</i> stamps it's name
in the area $1e-$38 when it formats a disk. Which is how I know T.V.I.
used Fastcopy to format the disks for their <i>'The Year After'</i> megademo!
</p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>So what use can all that nonsense possibly be? </p>
<p>Firstly, when you're formatting disks, you've got to get the structure
of the bootsector right, or the disk will behave strangely, or not at all.
</p>
<p>Secondly, you might want to put your own custom 'antivirus' bootsector
on all your disks, and annoy your friends and contacts no end! If you want
to be really annoying, why not write a virus as well- That'll really piss
them off! (I am not being serious of course.) </p>
<p>Thirdly, you might want to write a demo... Ahhhh, well, I'm not telling
you too much about that yet. </p>
<p>All you really need to know is the magic 4 steps to installing a bootsector.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the bootsector into memory. </li>
<li>Do what ever you want to do with it. </li>
<li>Make sure you've got the right checksum on it. </li>
<li>Write it back out to disk. </li>
</ol>
<p>In this (nice long) article, I'm concentrating on putting some good
old assembler mnemonics into the bootsector, from a simple virus-free message
to a more complex antivirus warning system. </p>
<p>You might already have got source which installed 68000 code on a bootsector.
If you haven't, then there should be a pretty simple example in ' <a href="boot.s">BOOT.S</a>
' which does the above four steps. Let's look at them in a bit more detail.
</p>
<ol>
<li>How could possibly read the bootsector into memory?? What's that I
hear? <i>trap #13</i> rwabs or <i>trap #14</i> floprd call? Yes, that sounds
a good idea. Quick delve into <i>ST Internals</i>. Yes, that's a good idea.
</li>
<li>So we've got our original bootsector in a 512 byte buffer. First we
need to put our <b>bra.s + $1e</b> right at the start of the buffer. To
do this, just put the word value <b>$601e</b> at the start of the buffer.
Then we need to copy our bootcode into the buffer starting $1e bytes after
that. You might also want to change the 'loader' and serial number as well!
</li>
<li>For an executable bootsector to be executable, then sum of all the
word values must equal <b>$1234!</b> You can do this with the <i>trap #14</i>
proboot call, though you can do it yourself by simply adding up all the
word values in the bootsector buffer until byte 510, subtracting the result
from $1234, and putting the (word) result in bytes 511-512. </li>
<li>How could you possibly write a 512 byte buffer to disk. Yes, surprise,
it's that good old <i>trap #13</i> rwabs again, or a <i>trap #14</i> flopwr
call. And that's all there is. </li>
</ol>
<p>So having convinced you of how stunningly easy it is to put any old
crap on your bootsector, let's make an antivirus bootsector! </p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>Generally, an antivirus is a bootsector which is there to stop any antiviruses
edging in on it. Some more complex ones may help to detect viruses eg flash
whenever a disk has an executable bootsector. However, they do NOT spread,
so I would suspect that stuff like the <i>English/Dutch/German 'antivirus'</i>
is really a virus which merely spreads under the pretence that it does
not do any nasty virus type things like reverse mouse controls, wipe disks,
etc., etc., .... </p>
<p>The simplest type of antivirus bootsector is the sort that just says
that it's there, so if any virus overwrites it, then you'll notice. This
is usually simple stuff like flashing colours and a text message. There
are 2 examples of this in my source code, one in ' <a href="boot.s">BOOT.S</a>
' and the other in ' <a href="phnx_bt.s">PHNX_BT.S</a> '. I've also done
an installer program for '<a href="phnx_bt.s">PHNX_BT.S</a> ', which allows
you to type in any message you want to display with the bootsector! Look
in '<a href="installp.s">INSTALLP.S</a>'. </p>
<p>I might as well note here that there have been some stunning examples
of this bootsector. For example, the <i>OVR full-o-boot, Fingerbobs sprites,
Oberjee's rasters, Oberjee's starfield, DCK boot</i>. All of them done
in less than 512 bytes! </p>
<p>The bootsector in '<a href="phnx_bt.s">PHNX_BT.S</a>' also checks to
see in the reset vector has been changed, a possible pointer to a reset-proof
virus. However, it is probably a bit more likely that any virus will be
<i>reset-resident</i>, (eg <i>Ghost</i> virus) which uses a different technique
entirely. </p>
<p>Without giving the whole game away to all you budding virus coders,
reset- resident code depends arranging code at a specific area in memory,
and, like bootsectors, doing a checksum of this block of code to make sure
it comes to a certain number. (But it's not $1234!) At the start of the
block of code, there's a "magic number". Basically, all you have
to do is look for this number. The first leaders in this sort of antivirus
were the <i>Medway Boys Protectors</i>. (Although <i>Protector v3.0</i>
isn't 4 meg compatible.) Of course, my own Agraboot 2 is compatible and
can check for reset-resident code! </p>
<p>Slightly more complex are the sort of bootsetors which use techniques
used by virus writers to warn of potential viruses BEFORE you try and boot
them up! (This is what this masterwork of an article is leading to, by
the way!) You know the sort. If a disk with an executable is placed in
the drive, as soon as it's accessed, the screen flashes, and there might
even be some sort of beep or horrible chip-noise. Examples of this are
<i>Exorcist Boot</i>, and of course the <i>English/Dutch/German 'antivirus'</i>.
(Except that it also spreads like a virus.) </p>
<p>Actually, while we're at it, I must protest as the way that such bootsectors
readily flash at every executable bootsector! </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Nearly every PD or shareware disk these days has an antivirus bootsector,
and of course all games and demos which use DMA loading have executable
bootsectors. Which means that whatever disk you put in these days, your
'smart' antivirus will flash at them, whether they are disk threatening
viruses or harmless <i>'Grythyx says hi to Bubblelob and Zoltar the aroused
radio set.'</i> type messages. [Don't ask] It's also incredibly easy to
say <i>'Yeah, the screen's flashing but it's alright, it's only because
I put an antivirus on that disk last week.'</i>, when, during the last
week, a virus could have installed itself on that disk! As yet, there is
no antivirus bootsector I have seen that can tell the difference between
a virus and an ordinary executable bootsector. Until now, that is! For
this is exactly what I'm going to do. </p>
<p>In what way can this be acheived? To do this, we need to look at the
way a virus on the ST would operate. Don't worry- I'm not giving any exact
details, so all you budding virus writers are going to be disappointed
Anyway, you'd have to be pretty clever to outwit most decent virus killer
programs these days. I have included code for the <i>English 'Antivirus'</i>
for reference in '<a href="anti.s">ANTI.S</a>' </p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>When you think on it, a virus spreads in a pretty similar way to the
magic 4 steps described above. All we need is a way of calling this routine
every time a new disk is inserted, and a safe place in which to reside
in memory. </p>
<p>One safe bit in memory would be in the area <b>$140-$3ff</b>. Certainly
the <i>Ghost</i> virus resides in this area. However the <i>English 'Antivirus'</i>
takes an address from the memory location <b>$4c6</b>, adds $600 to it,
and treats this as a safe place to put it's routines!!!! It works, but
it seems strange to say the least. </p>
<p>Leafing through <i>ST Internals</i>, <b>$4c6</b> is reffered to as a
'pointer to a 1024 byte disk buffer' which is 'used for GSX routines'!!!!
<i>GSX?!??!?</i> And isn't $600 one and a half kilobytes?? That's 3 normal
sectors worth, you know! Well, after looking closer at a couple of virus
codes, it became obvious to me that it was nothing to do with GSX, but
a buffer containing the bootsector and 2 other sectors, (FATs?) which is
set every time a normal disk directory is read, by... who?... what?...
where?.... what routine? Aha! We have found both a way of reading the bootsector,
and a possible way of calling our routines! </p>
<p>The vector which fills out all this information is <b>get_bpb</b> vector
in <b>$472</b>. When this is called by the system, it pushes the drive
number as a word value onto the stack, then jumps to the vector. </p>
<p>Note- the way the <i>English 'Antivirus'</i> finds a safe place in memory
is a bit dodgy to be honest, as it assumes only $600 bytes are used, when
in fact it could be more (eg if there's a bigger directory, and more FATs
are read.)It's also pretty dodgy if you've got a hard drive, which uses
a lot of FATs! For these reasons, the <i>'antivirus'</i> can crash very
badly on other Atari systems, but- get this- the <i>Ghost</i> virus still
works! </p>
<p>Now we've got all the information we need to piece together our antivirus.
Don't believe me? Let's go through the various steps of an antivirus and
it's constituent parts one by one. First the installation of the routine.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When your ST executes the bootcode, first find some place in memory.
</li>
<li>Copy your bootsector code to that area, and jump to the next instruction
there. </li>
<li>Save the current <b>get_bpb</b> vector, and slot in your virus detect
code into that vector. </li>
<li>Return to system. </li>
</ol>
<p>And now your virus detect code. </p>
<ol>
<li><b>jsr</b> through the old <b>get_bpb</b> vector (to get the bootsector).
</li>
<li>Examine the bootsector. </li>
<li>If it's executable, then flash the screen. </li>
<li>If it's a potential virus, then really flash it! </li>
<li>Return to system. </li>
</ol>
<p>Finding the safe place in memory we've already covered. Copying the
virus to that place BEFORE installing the routine in the <b>get_bpb</b>
vector is vital because the bootsector uses pc-relative code, so installing
your routine would mean that the <b>get_bpb</b> would point to some high
point in ST memory rather than the safe place you actually intended for
it! It makes sense when you think about it. Copying bits of code to other
places is pretty simple stuff for the average ST assembler coder. So is
saving the old <b>get_bpb</b> vector and installing your own virus detect
routines. Remember that saving the old <b>get_bpb</b> is VITAL! </p>
<p>Once you've done that, you can display a nice message, informing the
user how helpful your nice antivirus is. You might notice that my antivirus
flashes the screen in a similar way to <i>Future Minds Boul Boot</i>. I
bet you'll kick yourself when you see how I did it! </p>
<p>Now down to the nitty gritty of the virus detect code. While the likes
of the <i>Ghost</i> virus isn't too fussy about what's in the bootsector
(Because it's gonna write over it anyway), an antivirus needs to have a
look at the bootsector, so the first thing to do is <b>jsr</b> through
the old <b>get_bpb</b> vector to get the bootsector. The slight complication
in all of this is that we have to get the drive number and push it as a
word value on the stack before the <b>jsr</b>. That value will have already
been given by the system before it turned up in your <b>get_bpb</b> code!!
So it'll be on the stack, behind the return address. All you have to do
is get it. </p>
<p>In the <i>English 'Antivirus'</i> this is done by using the <b>link</b>
command. (Which I had never used in coding before.) <i>'link an,#n'</i>
apparently means link address register an to the stack at the current moment
with an offset of n. So, in the <i>'antivirus'</i> code we have 'link a6,#0'
which means that a6 is now pointing to where the stack is at that particular
point, and no matter how much you fiddle about with the stack, a6 will
stay where it is. I personally think now that this is not exactly the best
way of doing it, especially since drive number is now in 8(a6) rather than
4(a6) as you might expect. Still, that's how I did it in <i>Agraboot v1.0</i>,
so you know what to improve. Anyway, however you get the number, push it
on the stack, <b>jsr</b> through the old <b>get_bpb</b> vector, then correct
the stack. </p>
<p>Now we've got the bootsector in the buffer pointed to by $4c6, how do
we determine if it's executable or not? What's that I hear you say? Oh
yes! If the checksum comes to $1234, then the bootsector is executable!
So we add up all the word values in the buffer, and if it comes to $1234,
then we flash the screen! Of course, we'll put some code to check that
it's not our own antivirus but that's pretty easy. Hurrah hurrah! We've
now got an antivirus that is the equal of any on the scene! </p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>But of course, we can go further. My <i>Agraboot v1.0</i> antivirus
flashes the screen at an executable bootsector, but flashes <i>red</i>
at a probable virus!!! As far as I can tell, this is the only antivirus
bootsector which has this feature. But since I am of the opinion that this
sort of feature should be a bit more widespread, then I'll share the secret
with you lucky readers!!! </p>
<p>Actually, there's nothing much to it. When you think on it, what is
common to every virus? What have all viruses got to do to be viruses? Yes,
they've got to spread!! So we look for the part which saves a virus onto
the bootsector. Well, that's easy-peasy, we look for a <i>trap #13</i>
rwabs call or a <i>trap #14</i> flopwr call. </p>
<p>Let's look at the offending calls in hexidecimal. </p>
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="CENTER"><b><font color="#000080">INSTRUCTION</font></b></td>
<td><b><font color="#000080">HEX CODE</font></b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>move.w  #4,-(sp)
trap    #13</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>$3f3c0004
$4e4d</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>move.w  #9,-(sp)
trap    #14</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>$3f3c0009
$4e4e</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>As you can see, the offending instructions begin with a <b>$3f3c</b>,
so if we find one in the virus bootsector, then we can check further for
the rest of the incriminating bytes. If so, we can flash 'red for suspicious'.
This is not exactly foolproof, but it can detect most viruses. </p>
<p>If you want to see how I did then you can load up ' <a href="agraboot.s">AGRABOOT.S</a>
'. It's old code now, and I've improved it, but it's quite nice. There's
also an installer program for it in ' <a href="installa.s">INSTALLA.S</a>'.
</p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>I did sneakily mention the part that bootsectors play in demos above.
I'll not give too much away, since I'm actually helping to put one together
at the moment, but let's say you have your DMA loader working, but you
can't fit it on a 512 byte bootsector. (Which I think is probable, don't
you?) How do you load the DMA loader into memory and start the demo proper?
If you haven't guessed by now then there's no hope. Use <i>trap #13</i>
to sector load the DMA loader. Then you can jump to it. The advantage here
is that there's lots of space to allow you to put in some really annoying
protection into your demo!!! </p>
<p>You can even use a bootsector, even if you are not using a DMA loader!
Yes! You can put something like a simple screen fade into the bootsector
before the AUTO program loads, making it look like a <i>real</i> demo!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><hr/><p></p>
<p>So, that's just a glimpse (Oh dear, what a cliche.) at the amazing power
of the bootsector. If you wan't to know more, don't ask me, as I am just
about to fall asleep because it is now nearly 2:30 am, and I, like most
human beings, try to get to sleep at around this time, instead of typing
stuff which should have been in ST Internals anyway. Think about that the
next time you boot up a disk. </p>
