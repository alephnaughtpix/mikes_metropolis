                        - PURE BOLLOCKS #23 (27/3/93) -

              ** F A L C O N * F I X E D * ( 1 8 / 9 / 9 3 ) **

Welcome to Pure Bollocks #23- in 2 nice Magic Shadow Archiver chunks this time!
This is because PB #23 is on 2  disks,  so get the companion PB22B.LZH file! To
read this magazine, you need 4 things.

1)  The right files:
        PB23A.ZIP       (Which you must have if you're reading this!)
        PB23B.ZIP       (Which you should have as it's the second disk!)
2)  TWO good 3.5" disks that can stand having 82 tracks and 10 sectors on them.
3)  An Atari ST. (Well, it is an ST magazine!)
4)  The Magic Shadow archiver- this  is  the  standard  disk arc-er that all ST
    comms enthusiasts use, so if you don't have it already- it should be pretty
    easy to get hold of!  Try and get the MSA II program, as that's far better
    than the crappy old Magic Shadow Archiver shell!

To de-arc this mag, load up  Magic  Shadow  on  one drive- make this the source
drive. Put the disk with the .MSA files (PB23A.MSA) in this source drive. Click
on the filename to select  the  .MSA file,  then stick the aforementioned blank
disk  into  the  destination drive.  Click on the button marked  "FILE -> DISK"
to start the process of de-arcing!  Then you go  through the same process  with 
the other .MSA file (PB23B.MSA) and the second blank disk.When you're finished-
hey presto, a working Pure Bollocks #23 diskmag! (Which works on the Falcon
now!)

NOTE TO ALL NON-GLASWEGIAN OR NON-SCOTTISH READERS:
    If you wonder about the strange title  of our diskmag, then let us explain.
    In Glasgow (the  Scottish  city)  "pure"  is  often  used  as  an adjective
    equivalent to "complete" or "absolute". "Bollocks"  is a fairly widely used
    slang in Britain, and  is  a  stronger  equivalent  to  "rubbish", and only
    occasionally refers to  the  male  genitals!  (Well,  how  else  would  you
    explain the phrase "a load of  bollocks?!?!)  So an equivalent to the title
    "Pure Bollocks" would be "Complete Bullshit".  It's a kind of ironic title,
    and before we actually finished our  first  issue,  we thought it was quite
    accurate as well! (Thankfully it's turned out to be fairly good now.) So if
    any of you were worried, then we  can  assure you that it's not a religious
    tract on the evils of sex, or a load of porno text files (like Maggie 10!).
