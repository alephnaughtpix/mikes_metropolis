            <dt><h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>Scotland's resources are vast and varied, her people 
            skilled and dynamic, and her name and history respected 
            throughout the world. By rights, we should be a 
            confident, open people, enjoying living in one of the 
            wealthiest nations in Europe. Instead, we are forced to 
            devote all of our resources and energy to resisting the 
            policies of an English Tory government which we neither 
            voted for nor believe in. It's time to put these 
            wasted, futile years behind us and become an 
            independent nation once again.<p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="steps">The Steps to Independence</a></h2>
            </dt><dd><ol>
            <li>The SNP win a majority of Scottish seats at a 
            General Election.<br>
            </li><li>We keep the Scottish Office running while 
            negotiating Independence.<br>
            </li><li>After the negotiations are complete, we register 
            the agreement with the 
            UN, while remaining part 
            of the European Union.<br>
            
            </li><li>A referendum on a written Constitution takes 
            place.<br>
            </li><li>Within a month of the referendum, a new General 
            Election is held to elect an Independent Scottish 
            Parliament.
            </li></ol>
           <br>
            </dd><dt><h2><a name="constit">A Written Constitution for Scotland</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>An independent Scotland, like most modern democracies, will
            have a written Constitution incorporating a Bill of 
            Rights.<p>
           <br>
            </p><ul>
            <li>Guaranteed rights and liberties for all, at least 
            as extensive as the European Convention on Human 
            Rights.
           <br>
            </li><li>The right of the Scottish people to sovereignty 
            over our own territory and natural resources, 
            recognising the rights and obligations we have as 
            members of the European Union.
           <br>
            </li><li>The right of Scottish citizenship to everyone born 
            in Scotland, to everyone living in Scotland, and to 
            others as decided by Parliament.
           <br>
            </li><li>The Head of State to remain the Queen and her 
            successors, until such time as the people of Scotland 
            decide otherwise.
            </li></ul>
           <br>
            </dd><dt><h2><a name="europe">Europe</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>With Independence, Scotland will become a full Member 
            State of the European Union, with a 
            voice, votes and the power of veto in the Council of 
            Ministers, the EU's primary decision-making body.<p>
            The SNP support the development of the EU as a 
            confederal and equal partnership between democratic 
            nations, rather than a centralised, federal European 
            "super-state".</p><p>
            An independent Scotland will immediately opt back in to 
            the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="jobs">Action for Jobs</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>Only with Independence in Europe can Scotland be put 
            back on the road to full employment, which we aim to 
            achieve over the course of a four-year Scottish 
            Parliament. Our ambition for Scotland is for a high 
            wage, highly skilled and highly competitive economy.<p>
            The Scottish National Party will introduce a range of 
            schemes designed to encourage and assist businesses, 
            including a Scottish Exports Unit and an Industrial 
            Equity and Investment Fund. Training provision will be 
            improved, with the creation of a National 
            Apprenticeship Scheme, for example.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="poverty">An Attack on Poverty</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>Scotland still suffers from a degree of real poverty 
            which is shameful for such a rich nation.<p>
            The SNP favour an urgent review of the Social Security
            system, including increased pensions and the full
            restoration of social security entitlement to 16 and 17
            year olds. A Cold Climate Allowance will be paid
            automatically during the winter to everyone on the
            Retirement Pension, Income Support, Family Credit and
            Housing Benefit.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="tax">Tax Reform</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>To help the low paid in particular, the SNP proposes a
            significant increase in personal tax allowances, over
            and above inflation. To pay for this, the SNP will
            remove the ceiling on employees' National Insurance
            Contributions.<p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="defence">Defence</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The SNP are committed to a non-nuclear Scotland. An
            independent Scotland will immediately withdraw from the
            Trident Programme and order 
            nuclear weapons and
            installations off our soil. An SNP government will
            establish strong conventional defences and seek to
            cooperate in defence matters with other European
            countries.<p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="education">Education for Life</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The Scottish National Party believe that investment in
            education is the best investment that any society can
            make.<p>
            The SNP is pledged to the provision of nursery
            education for all three and four year olds whose
            parents wish it. The SNP are committed to the creation
            of a highly motivated, highly skilled and well rewarded
            teaching profession. Tory legislation on opting out
            will be repealed.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="health">Health</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The SNP are totally committed to the retention and
            development of a comprehensive health care system which
            is free to all at the point of need.<p>
            The SNP believe in increasing Health Service resources
            so that Scottish spending is in line with the European
            average. Charges for eye care and essential dental work
            will be abolished, and prescription charges frozen.
            Privatisation within the health service will be
            abolished.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="pensions">Pensions</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>As well as advocating an increase in the basic state
            pension for Scots pensioners, an independent Scotland
            will use her voice in the European Union to campaign
            for a Common European Pension of #90 UK pounds for a
            single person and #130 for a married couple.<p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="safe">Living in a Safe Scotland</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The SNP are also completely opposed to the dumping of
            imported nuclear waste in Scotland. We will not let
            Scotland become the nuclear dustbin of the developed
            world.<p>
            The SNP favour a Scottish Environmental Agency as a
            dynamic body with new responsibility to coordinate
            anti-pollution and conservation efforts. The SNP will
            support all international initiatives on the
            environment.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="housing">Housing for People</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>Over half of all money paid in rent for council housing
            goes straight back out to repay housing debt.<p>
            The SNP will transfer the housing debt of Scottish
            local authorities to central government, freeing up
            over #1 billion (UK pounds) for new build and housing
            improvements.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="rural">The Rural Economy</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>For farming, the SNP will establish an Agricultural
            Finance Bank, devise a new entrants scheme that works,
            and seek to extend the less favoured areas programme by
            means of a structural plan to strengthen the rural
            economy.<p>
            For fishing, the SNP will establish an effective
            decommisioning scheme, on a par with our European
            neighbours, and will pursue other appropriate
            conservation regimes. The invasion of the 'Spanish
            Armada' into Scottish fishing waters will be
            opposed.</p><p>
            The SNP propose the setting up of a Land Commission to
            ensure fair and productive use of Scotland's land, and
            the establishment of a task force for the regeneration
            of the Western Isles economy.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="disabled">Help for the Disabled</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The SNP will ensure that disabled people can live their
            lives without suffering from discrimination and
            hardship. In an independent Scotland, the 3 per cent
            legal quota for employers regarding the employment of
            disabled people will be rigorously enforced.<p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="equality">Independence and Equality</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The written Constitution of an Independent Scotland
            will contain a provision outlawing any discrimination
            on the grounds of gender, race, age, belief or sexual
            orientation. The SNP will seek to ensure that an
            independent Parliament has a fairer balance of the
            sexes, and will strive for equal pay for work of equal
            value, in line with the best European guidelines.<p>
            The SNP utterly reject any discrimination on racial or
            ethnic grounds. The presence in Scotland of people from
            diverse backgrounds is a source of enrichment for
            Scottish society.</p><p>
           <br>
            </p></dd><dt><h2><a name="arts">The Arts and Media</a></h2>
            </dt><dd>The SNP will create a Ministry for Arts, and will
            establish independent Scottish broadcasting
            institutions. The diversity of arts in a multi-cultural
            Scotland will be maintained.<p>
