<dt><h3>Who is GUSNA?</h3>
</dt><dd><strong>Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association (GUSNA)</strong> 
    is the official club representing the 
    <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970121062406/http://www.snp.org.uk/">Scottish National Party (SNP)</a></strong> 
    amongst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970121062406/http://www.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow University</a> students.
</dd><dt><h3>Who are the SNP, and what do they support?</h3>
</dt><dd>The SNP is a left-of-centre political party whose main objective is to
    campaign for Scotland to become an independent nation within the European
    Community. The party also has also formulated 
    <a href="policies.html">polices</a> which it would pursue if elected to
    an independent Scottish Parliament.
</dd><dt><h3>Where does GUSNA fit within the SNP?</h3>
</dt><dd>GUSNA is actually <strong>older</strong> than the SNP. It was formed in 1927
    by a law student, <strong>John McCormick</strong>. At the time there were
    two nationalist political parties, the <strong>National Party of Scotland</strong>
    and the <strong>Scottish Movement</strong>. Seven years later, the two parties
    were merged at a meeting in Hillhead Burgh Halls (just down the road from the
    computer which contains these Web pages). The main negociations were carried
    out by John McCormick.
</dd><dt><h3>What does GUSNA do today?</h3>
</dt><dd>We hold meetings on subjects of interest to students, including meetings
    with speakers from the SNP and related organisations. We also stand in
    student elections, and hold social functions.
